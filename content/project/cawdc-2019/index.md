I'm looking for funding to improve this project by: (1) automating the reporting system, and (2) expanding the display to include historical trends in water quality and compliance. Please [contact me](http://richpauloo.com/#contact) if you have any leads.

# Summary 

Present sources of water quality information in California (i.e. - consumer confidence reports, or CCRs) are fragmented across thousands of water utilities in the state, lack consistency and clarity, and tend to communicate data via hard-to-understand tables (see 3 examples of CCRs below, or view them in their entirely[^1].). 

{{< figure src="ccrs.png" title="CCRs in the wild: the good, the bad and the ugly." lightbox="true" >}}

Near-real-time, standardized, and easy to understand water quality reports would improve the public‚Äôs understanding of the water they buy and consume. Automated creation of water quality reports would ease reporting responsibilities for water agencies, freeing them to tackle harder problems.

This project aimed to build a ‚Äúweather app‚Äù for California community water system water quality. The benefits of this approach include standardization, consistency across agencies, ease of use, and near-real-time water quality information.

The project aggregates publicly available water quality data for all California community water systems to report:  

* compliance status  
* chemicals detected within the past 2 years  
* average detection levels for all contaminants tested for  
* water quality indicators  
* local water and health system contact information
