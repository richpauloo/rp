# old academic bio:
# Groundwater resources support global food supply and civilization, yet are in decline worldwide. I use my background in hydrogeology and data science to develop scalable and scientific methods to monitor, model, and manage regional-scale aquifers. I've built open source frameworks for real-time groundwater monitoring, models that predict if a well may run dry during drought or unsustainable management, and 3D physical simulations of groundwater flow and contaminant transport.

# I'm a data scientist at LWA and spend most of my time in `R` automating ETL pipelines for sensor networks 📡, building Shiny Apps and dashboards 🖥, designing approaches with spatial statistics and hydrologic models, and generally wrangling lots and lots of data. 
 
# I have a PhD in Hydrology and my dissertation is titled *'Emerging consequences of regional-scale aquifer depletion: data-driven and numerical models of well failure, basin salinization, and contaminant transport'* [(my exit seminar can be viewed here)](https://www.richpauloo.com/talk/2020-exit-seminar/). Early in my PhD, I found that I really enjoyed data science and programming, and I used these years to sharpen those skills. My published research includes [NLP and network analysis](https://www.richpauloo.com/publication/cig/), [spatial statistics](https://www.richpauloo.com/publication/well-failure/), and [physical modeling of 3D, subsurface contaminant transport](https://www.richpauloo.com/publication/vhgr/).
# 
# I'm an #rstats nerd and automation/reproducibility fanatic. My favorite tools include tidyverse (`dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `purrr`), `shiny`, `flexdashboard`, `DT`, `RMarkdown` (for dashbaords/reporting), `sf`, `sp`, `raster`, `leaflet` (for spatial data), and `DBI` for databases. A few projects I'm proud of include an [`R` package to query water quality data 📦](https://caopenwater.github.io/sdwisard/), [R data science curriculum 📚](https://r4wrds.com/), a dashboard that makes [millions of water quality observations understandable 📈](http://calwaterquality.com/), and a model that [predicts the risk of wells going dry 💧](https://www.gspdrywells.com/) funded by Microsoft's AI for Earth Grant.  
# 
# Before my PhD, I taught environmental science to middle and high school students in Yosemite and the Marin Headlands for the educational nonprofit [NatureBridge](https://naturebridge.org/). I spent summers leading expeditions in the wilderness, and in Thailand for [National Geographic Student Expeditions](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/student-expeditions/).
# 
# In my free time, I enjoy anything that puts me in a flow state: alpine climbing 🧗🏼, running 🏃‍♂️, surfing 🏄‍♂️, tinkering on bikes 🚴‍♂️, reading 📚, playing guitar 🎸, and cooking 🧑‍🍳.

I spend most of my days writing code (mostly `R`, `Python`, `SQL`) to clean, visualize, and model data. I have a PhD in computational hydrogeology, where I simulated and visualized 3D contaminant transport in aquifers. 

I love to surf 🏄‍, climb mountains  🧗🏼, tinker on bikes 🚴‍, read and learn new things 📚, play guitar 🎸, and cook 🧑‍🍳.
