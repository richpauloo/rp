Groundwater resources support global food supply and civilization, yet are in decline worldwide. I use my background in hydrogeology and data science to develop scalable and scientific methods to monitor, model, and manage regional-scale aquifers. I've built open source frameworks for real-time groundwater monitoring, models that predict if a well may run dry during drought or unsustainable management, and 3D physical simulations of groundwater flow and contaminant transport.

I'm passionate about data literacy and STEM education, the outdoors, and {{% staticref "files/expedition-behavior.pdf" %}}expedition behavior{{% /staticref %}}. Before pursuing a PhD, I taught environmental science to middle and high school students in Yosemite and the Marin Headlands for the educational nonprofit [NatureBridge](https://naturebridge.org/), and spent summers leading expeditions in the wilderness, and in Thailand for [National Geographic Student Expeditions](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/student-expeditions/). I love the challenge of guiding tight knit groups from different cultures across difficult terrain, speaking to large crowds, communicating to diverse audiences, and improvising. 

In my free time, I enjoy alpine climbing, running, surfing, tinkering on bikes, reading, playing guitar, and cooking extravagant dinners.
