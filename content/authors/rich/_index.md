I'm currently a PhD Candidate studying physical hydrogeology at the University of California Davis with [Dr. Graham Fogg](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Graham_Fogg). My research interests concern the monitoring and modeling of vast underground aquifers -- finite water stores in the Earth's crust extracted for human consumption. Methodologically, I integrate tools from geostatistics, 3D groundwater flow and contaminant transport, statistical/machine learning, optimization, calibration, and mathematical modeling to explain and forecast the behavior of hydrologic systems. I'm also fascinated by remote sensor networks, data science, data visualization/communication, and the power of open source software.

Before pursuing my PhD, I taught environmental science to middle and high school students in Yosemite and the Marin Headlands for the educational nonprofit [NatureBridge](https://naturebridge.org/), and spent summers leading expeditions in the wilderness, and in Thailand for [National Geographic Student Expeditions](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/student-expeditions/). Those were some of the best years of my life. I learned how to work with tight knit groups of people for weeks on end, speak comfortably to large crowds, communicate science to diverse audiences, and improvise. 

I love to learn new things, cook, play guitar, explore the alpine environment with a rope and harness, take bike tours, and catch waves in the cold California ocean.
