# old academic bio:
# Groundwater resources support global food supply and civilization, yet are in decline worldwide. I use my background in hydrogeology and data science to develop scalable and scientific methods to monitor, model, and manage regional-scale aquifers. I've built open source frameworks for real-time groundwater monitoring, models that predict if a well may run dry during drought or unsustainable management, and 3D physical simulations of groundwater flow and contaminant transport.

I'm a data scientist with a background in physical science (hydrology, fluid mechanics, geology, statistical methods, optimization, geospatial science), computing (sensor networks, cloud computing, open source software development), and physics (mathematical and numerical modeling, contaminant transport).  

I have coded workflows to automate ETL jobs from from [hundreds of remote sensor networks 📡](https://www.richpauloo.com/project/lcsn/); built dashboards and interactive data visualizations to bring clarity to [datasets with millions of observations 📈](http://calwaterquality.com/); created 3D numerical physical simulation models of [groundwater flow and contaminant transport 🖥️](https://www.richpauloo.com/publication/vhgr/); explored ways to improve machine learning [interpretability 🌳](https://twitter.com/RichPauloo/status/1124470765095538688); built [R packages 📦](https://github.com/richpauloo/textme); won an AI for Earth Grant to model the risk of [domestic wells going dry in California's Central Valley 💧](https://www.gspdrywells.com/); and developed [R data science curriculum 📚](https://r4wrds.com/).  

Ask me about data literacy and STEM education, the outdoors, and {{% staticref "files/expedition-behavior.pdf" %}}expedition behavior{{% /staticref %}}. Before pursuing a PhD, I taught environmental science to middle and high school students in Yosemite and the Marin Headlands for the educational nonprofit [NatureBridge](https://naturebridge.org/), and spent summers leading expeditions in the wilderness, and in Thailand for [National Geographic Student Expeditions](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/student-expeditions/). I love the challenge of guiding tight knit groups from different cultures across difficult terrain, speaking to large crowds, communicating to diverse audiences, and improvising. 

In my free time, I enjoy alpine climbing 🧗🏼, running 🏃‍♂️, surfing 🏄‍♂️, tinkering on bikes 🚴‍♂️, reading 📚, playing guitar 🎸, and cooking extravagant dinners 🧑‍🍳.
