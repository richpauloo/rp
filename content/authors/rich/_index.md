I'm a hydrogeologist and data scientist developing scientific methods to monitor, model, and manage regional-scale aquifers, with applications in sustainable groundwater management, agricultural water use, and real-time natural resource monitoring. I've built simulations of groundwater flow and contaminant transport, open source frameworks for real-time groundwater monitoring, and models that predict if a well may run dry during drought or unsustainable management.

I'm also passionate about science education and the outdoors. Before pursuing a PhD, I taught environmental science to middle and high school students in Yosemite and the Marin Headlands for the educational nonprofit [NatureBridge](https://naturebridge.org/), and spent summers leading expeditions in the wilderness, and in Thailand for [National Geographic Student Expeditions](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/student-expeditions/). I love the challenge of guiding tight knit groups for weeks on end in far corners of the Earth, speaking to large crowds, communicating to diverse audiences, and improvising. 

In my free time, I enjoy running, surfing, climbing mountains, building bikes, reading, practicing guitar, and cooking extravagant dinners.
