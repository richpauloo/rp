Here's a boilied down method to configure add a custom domain (e.g., username.com) to your github pages website (e.g., username.github.io).   

# Step 1

Buy a domain (e.g., richpauloo.com). I used godaddy.com, but you can use any number of domain name registries.  

# Step 2  

In your github.io repository Settings, add the domain you purchased in Step 1 to the "Custom domain box":

</center>

Make sure you do Step 2 before Step 3, for security reasons outlined in the [Official Github docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#about-custom-domain-configuration).  

# Step 3 

In your DNS Management console, add a CNAME record with the following parameters:  

* type = CNAME
* name = www
* value = username.github.io.


{{< figure library="true" src="gh_custom_domain.png" lightbox="true">}}

{{% alert note %}}
**Meaning:** This tells your DNS to point www.username.com requests towards the site hosted at username.github.io. Set the TTL (time to live) to an hour or less.  
{{% /alert %}}

Next, in your DNS Management console, add 4 separate A records with the following information:  

* type = A  
* name = @  
* points to (value) = IP   
  

{{< figure library="true" src="gh_a_records.png" >}}

For IP, supply the Github IP addresses that host your username.github.io site. As of writing (2019-11-15) these IPs are: 

```r
185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153
```

However the values might have changed since the time of writing. See the [offical docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#about-custom-domain-configuration) for the most up-to-date values.  

{{% alert note %}}
**Meaning:** "A" records connect your domain name (hosted by your DNS) to the actual IP addresses where your site lives on a server (at Github). 
{{% /alert %}}

# Step 4

Nagivate to username.com to see your github page! Be patient if it doesn't immediately show. This lag is related to [DNS propogration](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9622/10/dns-propagation--explained).

Here are three resources I found helpful while doing this:

1. [Offical docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#about-custom-domain-configuration)
2. [An unoffical guide](https://medium.com/@hossainkhan/using-custom-domain-for-github-pages-86b303d3918a).  
3. [Nice explanation of A records](https://www.godaddy.com/help/add-an-a-record-19238)
