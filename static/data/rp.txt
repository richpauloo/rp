On a global level, groundwater accounts for 70% of freshwater withdrawals and 90% of consumptive water (Siebert et al., 2010). Global declines in groundwater storage have mobilized an increase in  groundwater quantity monitoring efforts (Famiglietti, 2014; Feng et al., 2013; Gleeson et al., 2012). In arid and semiarid regions, groundwater plays the important role of providing long-term storage capacity to bridge the gap between wet and dry years (Nativ, 2004). In California’s semiarid and agriculturally-dominated Central Valley, historical groundwater storage declines have been estimated by regional-scale models of the interconnected surface and groundwater reservoir network at approximately 150 km3, or 120 million acre-feet (MAF) over the last century (Brush et al., 2013; Faunt ed., 2009), roughly the volume of Lake Tahoe. Groundwater supplies nearly 30% of the state’s water in average years, which increases to 40% in dry years, and up to 60% during drought years (CDWR, 2014). In 2007, the agricultural industry in the Central Valley provided upwards of $40 billion in agricultural, value-added, and processed products, and contributed 5% towards state employment (Hanak et al., 2011). A majority of the groundwater storage change in the Central Valley of California takes place within the agriculturally-intensive and arid southern portion (Brush et al., 2013), furthermore referred to as the Tulare Basin.      Figure 1: The Tulare Basin in California’s southern Central Valley comprises eight water management regions (CVPM regions 14-21) and 4 counties: Kings, Kern, Tulare and Fresno. Notable centers of population include the cities of Fresno, Visalia, and Bakersfield.      Concurrent to groundwater storage declines in the Tulare Basin are declines in regional water quality, notably nitrates and inorganic contaminants in shallow aquifers (Harter et al., 2012), and salts in soil, measured as total dissolved solids (TDS) (Brumbaugh et al., 2002; Schoups et al., 2005). Nitrates in pumped groundwater pose threats to human health, whereas TDS contributes to water “hardness”, scale-formation on pipes which reduces the efficiency of industrial boilers. In high enough concentrations, TDS are detrimental to plant growth and yield (Hanson et al., 2006). In the Tulare Basin, extensive pumping of confined aquifers has lowered regional hydraulic heads such that baseflow to streams and lateral subsurface flow doesn’t occur—thus the basin is hydrologically closed. (Scanlon et al., 2012), thereby closing off natural outflows of groundwater to adjacent basins. Dissolved contaminants do not exit an internally-draining basin, and the transport of shallow contaminated groundwater into deep groundwater is inevitable. California’s groundwater crisis is therefore one of not only depleting groundwater quantity, but also of worsening quality, and the interplay between the two. Moreover, basin closure can occur even in basins that are not considered in a state of overdraft. Although traditionally treated as separate problems, groundwater storage declines in an internally-draining basin (i.e. – loss of storage, overdraft) are inexorably linked to inorganic groundwater quality decline (i.e. – increase in TDS and other dissolved contaminants). Research linking the gap between regional groundwater quantity is rare, as is research on how declines in regional groundwater quality can be managed.      Compounding these water quantity and quality challenges are the effects of climate change on California’s water storage portfolio. Climate change projections suggest more extreme precipitation events and a reduction of winter snowpack (Pachauri and Meyer, 2014; Tebaldi et al., 2006; Vicuña et al., 2011). More extreme winter precipitation events may be altogether released for flood control and to prevent overtopping of reservoirs. A reduction of mountain snowpack in the winter renders surface-water reservoirs designed for short-term storage inadequate to capture and store the diminished spring and summer season runoff (Dettinger et al., 2011)—as seen in the 2011-2017 drought in California (CDWR, 2014; Medellín-azuara et al., 2016). A recent study using the Central Valley Hydrologic Model (Faunt ed., 2009) estimated the Tulare Basin has freely-available storage capacity of upwards to 154 km3 (124 MAF) (Scanlon et al., 2016), about 4x the storage capacity of California’s combined surface water reservoirs 47 km3 (38.1 MAF). Beyond available shallow aquifer storage capacity, the Tulare Basin and the interconnected Central Valley Aquifer network has approximately 8.5 MAF to 1.3 billion acre-feet of storage capacity (CDWR, 1994, 1975), which can act as a buffer to shortages in surface water.             Over the past century, sources of recharge in the Tulare basin have shifted from natural, relatively clean sources of recharge such as precipitation and runoff to relatively unclean imported water for irrigation. Strategies like conjunctive use and managed aquifer recharge (MAR) are promising in that they might increase groundwater storage during wet periods for use during dry periods, thereby increasing total water storage and resilience of water infrastructure to shortages. However, it remains to be seen if declining groundwater quality from TDS in irrigated basins can be stabilized through smarter recharge management that includes more non-irrigation sources.       Shifting towards sustainable water management by banking more water in groundwater can mitigate social and ecological crises related to water shortages, increase resilience to droughts, and enable long-term storage and the emergence of water markets (Gleick, 1998; Scanlon et al., 2016). Key questions include where recharge water will come from, how it will get into aquifers, and whether cleaner recharge can offset declines in regional groundwater quality. Recent research suggests that high magnitude winter flows (i.e., flows above the 90th percentile), which in an average year total 3.5 km3 (2.8 MAF) throughout the state of California (Kocis and Dahlke, 2017), may offer a source by which to recharge the aquifer storage space available in the overdrafted Tulare Basin aquifer (Scanlon et al., 2016).  Scanlon et al. (2016) suggest that these flows might be directed along the Central Valley Project and State Water Project conveyance infrastructure, these flows would be directed along the Central Valley Project and State Water Project conveyance infrastructure, but research investigating the physics and economics of these transfers are lacking.      Although the benefits of regional-scale MAR on groundwater quantity and quality are potentially enormous, and overdrafted aquifers may provide the necessary storage capacity for those high magnitude flows, joint-operation of surface and groundwater reservoirs to optimize total water storage is not common practice in California, or other arid regions of the world. This is partially explained by the relatively recent increase in groundwater use, which rapidly increased worldwide in the 1990s (Wada et al., 2014), although in California, an increase in groundwater pumping is observed much earlier, for instance during the droughts of 1976-77 and 1987-92 (TNC, 2014). It is furthermore explained by fundamental methodological differences in the science of water-systems analysis and groundwater modeling. The field of physically based groundwater modeling studies slow-moving groundwater and emphasizes 3D hydrodynamic simulation models, and is limited in prescribing optimal management strategies. On the other hand, the field of water systems analysis grows out of civil engineering and tends to favor simulation and optimization models, and although multi-reservoir networks integrating groundwater reservoirs exist, groundwater flow and physics are often not represented. Because multi-reservoir networks tend to simplify groundwater processes, and groundwater for so long has acted as a safety net to surface water system shortage, these models usually optimize for carryover storage, environmental flow targets, flood control, hydropower, and other beneficial uses of surface water (Lin and Rutten, 2016; Loucks et al., 1981; Loucks and van Beek, 2017; Rogers, 1986). Integrating groundwater sustainability (i.e. – controls on groundwater overdraft and regional-scale MAR) into the optimization of a multi-reservoir model is more important than ever in the face of the global groundwater crisis (Brown et al., 2015), and will yield an understanding of the actual tradeoffs and costs sustainability comes at. Optimized groundwater water storages can then be linked to regional groundwater quality models to assess the progression of groundwater salinization under different water storage scenarios, thus linking regional-scale water quantity and quality models.  	This research seeks to define conceptual and numerical models of a relatively recent phenomenon—open-to-closed basin conversion by groundwater pumping, and subsequent regional groundwater salinization, and processes for groundwater remediation. Central to this research are the hypotheses that introducing relatively clean, low-TDS sources of recharge will improve regional groundwater quality, and filling a basin up until it discharges into surface water will slow or reverse closed-basin salinization. Lessons learned from this research will lead to the creation of the first ever, regional scale groundwater quality management models. Moreover, this research will add to the field of water systems analysis by developing methodologies for jointly-operating surface and groundwater reservoirs to maximize total water storage and assess metrics of groundwater quantity and quality sustainability.METHODOLOGICAL BACKGROUNDClosed Basin Hydrogeology      Closed hydrologic basins form when (1) basin outflow is absent or exceedingly minimal, (2) evaporation exceeds inflow in the basin, or (3) when both of these occur (Hardie and Eugster, 1970; Jones and Deocampo, 1978; Langbein, 1961). In a closed hydrologic basin with few to no discharge outlets, water predominately exits the basin through evapotranspiration, which leaves behind dissolved salts in the form of concentrated solutes that remain in basin and lead to progressive salinization and deterioration of water quality over time (Eugster and Hardie, 1978; Jones et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2002). Examples include the playas and salt flats of the Western basin and range (USA) and Salar de Uyuni (Bolivia), saline lakes such as the Great Salt Lake (USA) and the Dead Sea (Middle east), and extremely arid deserts such as the Arabian and Atacama (Cooke and Warren, 1973). By contrast, open hydrologic basins are far more common and have outlets for water other than evapotranspiration, and inflow exceeds evaporation.      The scientific literature on closed and open basins regard the two as separate, altogether ignoring the possibly that ‘open’ and ‘closed’ may be system-states, and transition from an open to a closed system-state may be possible given certain factors. The paucity of research on the topic of open-to-closed basin conversion is likely because: (1) a transition from an open to closed basin or vice versa requires an significant shift in a basin’s water budget, usually only observed over millennia to eons (Keigwin, 1978), and (2) methodologies of tracing these conversion events include paleoclimatology or biostratigraphy, which rely on measurements of δ18O and δ13C stable isotope covariance, a task that can be very challenging to accurately accomplish (Keigwin, 1978; Li, 1997; Yan et al., 2002).             Fundamental alterations in a water budget, as observed in many basins worldwide with large groundwater footprints (Gleeson et al., 2012) may accelerate the process of closed-basin formation. In a rapidly closing hydrologic basin, methods involving streamflow analysis might show decreases in baseflow over time suggestive of basin closure. The rising limb of a hydrograph is dominated by precipitation and runoff, whereas baseflow contribution to streams is observable in the falling limb (Tallaksen, 1995); during rapid open-to-closed basin formation, baseflow to streams should decrease as the basin closes. Methodologies to measure baseflow recession generally fall into either graphical hydrograph separation which rely on stream discharge data, and tracer mass balance methods which rely on measuring chemical species in the stream (Miller et al., 2015). Recent advancements in hydrographic separation methodologies have led to improved estimation of baseflow (Thomas et al., 2015), and may be an appropriate tool to explore open-to-closed basin conversion for hydrologic basins with long-term streamflow data. However, in the Tulare Basin, surface waters internally drain into the trough of the valley (Davis, 1959), rendering traditional methods of baseflow separation unsuitable due to a lack of data. Moreover, seasonal controls on water table and natural inter-annual variability of baseflow make it difficult to pick out long-term trends in baseflow reduction without significantly long-term data. Baseflow separation methodologies are thus inadequate to address this particular problem.            Regional water balance methods are perhaps the most obvious method of demonstrating the key features of closed basin formation. For instance, falling groundwater level elevations in spatially-distributed networks of monitoring wells (Brush et al., 2013), satellite gravity-based methods measuring aquifer storage change (Famiglietti, 2014), and measurements of land subsidence in the Tulare Basin (Faunt ed., 2009; TNC, 2014), coupled with internally draining surface waters, all strongly point towards a closed basin system-state in the Tulare Basin.             In a closing or closed-basin, inorganic groundwater quality deteriorates over long-term time scales (Hardie and Eugster, 1970; Yan et al., 2002), a trend which statistical analysis of regional TDS content observed in wells may be able to detect. By leveraging publically accessible data sets on groundwater quality in the Tulare Basin, this research aims to create descriptive regional statistics of inorganic groundwater quality suggestive of closed basin formation, to support the development and calibration of regional groundwater quality models. As data is aggregated from multiple sources, this analysis demands appropriate statistical methodologies for avoiding sample bias. Algorithms to decluster data into equal areas for unbiased sampling will be employed. Preliminary results suggest a changing system-state but the evolution of this system-state is, and how it will evolve under different water management scenarios, is an appropriate question for 3D hydrodynamic groundwater flow and transport models. Rates of TDS increase observed in the data will serve as calibration points for the model.            Climatological variability, surface water scarcity, population growth and the expansion of irrigated agriculture in the past half-century has led to greater groundwater extraction rates than ever before (Famiglietti, 2014; Gleeson et al., 2012), potentially enough in some regions to fundamentally change a hydrologic basin’s system-state from open to closed. Although numerous studies have mapped long-term declines in aquifer storage (Brush et al., 2013; Döll et al., 2012; Famiglietti, 2014; Faunt ed., 2009; Gleeson et al., 2012; Russo and Lall, 2017; Scanlon et al., 2012; Siebert et al., 2010; Vörösmarty et al., 2014), the impacts of decreased water quantity on regional groundwater quality are difficult to measure and model, and remain largely undefined. Is the global groundwater crisis not only an issue of declining water quantity, but also of declining water quality? Could these dramatic shifts in water budgets be large enough to set into motion the conversion from an open to a closed hydrologic system? This research broadens the scope of closed basin hydrogeology by investigating if a fresh, open hydrologic basin, fundamentally altered by groundwater development and pumping, may transition towards an evaporation-dominated closed basin system. The methodologies developed herein are general to the field of closed basin hydrology and may be applied to any groundwater basin at risk of open-to-closed system state conversion. Regional Nonpoint Source Pollution            After decades spent fighting to reduce point source contaminant emissions, nonpoint source emissions have become the leading source of pollution of US waterways (EPA, 2000). Nonpoint source pollution is partially to blame for losses of freshwater biodiversity in the Western US (Richter et al., 1997), and its emergence in groundwater has been traced primarily to agricultural sources (Dowd et al., 2008; Harter et al., 2012). Since the 1980s a growing body of literature has documented the emergence of regional, nonpoint source contamination which threatens potentially unsustainable declines in water quality at the basin or watershed scale (Buresh, 1986). Literature on the policy of regulating nonpoint source contaminants emphasizes theory, and empirical cases typically concern surface waters (Dowd et al., 2008; Larson et al., 1996; Romstad, 2003).             The literature on the physical science of mapping, understanding, and modeling nonpoint source follows regulation and funding. Surface waters, and urban to peri-urban waters are more regulated than groundwater in the US (i.e. – Clean Water Act, 1972), and the literature dedicated to these waters is more extensive (Beaulieu et al., 2014; Carey et al., 2014; Cun and Vilagines, 1997; Harrison et al., 2012; Kaushal et al., 2014, 2011). Nonetheless, initiatives to assess regional groundwater quality have been implemented in Europe (Grath et al., 2007; Ward et al., 2005) and in North America (Lapham et al., 2005; Lesage, 2005), and elsewhere (Mendizabal and Stuyfzand, 2009). In California, owing to the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, agriculturally-derived nonpoint source nitrate pollution is regulated (State Water Resources Control Board, 2002) and well documented (Harter et al., 2012; Ransom et al., 2017). The literature on nonpoint source contamination from naturally-occurring salts, however, is lacking.             Nonpoint source contamination from inorganic naturally-occurring salts enter the Tulare Basin from trace amounts of dissolved salt in surface water diversions for irrigation (CDM Smith, 2014), and from natural rock-water dissolution processes (Elango and Kannan, 2007). A recent study estimates 3.76 million tons of salt are imported via surface water into the Tulare Basin every year (CDM Smith, 2014), but to this author’s knowledge no studies have explored what the potential source of naturally-occurring salt from rock-water interactions may be. This research seeks to define statistical methods for determining rates of rock-water dissolution. Soil salinization from the evapoconcentration of salts near the land surface has long been managed by applying excess water (i.e. – leeching fraction) to flush salts from the root zone and into shallow groundwater, away from where they might cause harm to plants (Corwin et al., 2007; Hanson et al., 2006). Recently, salt accumulation in groundwater and the implications for regional groundwater quality sustainability (LWA, 2013), have been given attention by the Central Valley Salinity Alternatives for Long-Term Sustainability initiative.             In one previous study of regional nonpoint source contamination in the San Joaquin Valley, a coupled soil chemistry and regional groundwater flow and transport model using a MODFLOW rectangular finite difference mesh and the UNSATCHEM transport software, which solves for 1D solute transport and chemical equilibria in variably saturated media via the Richard’s equation and dispersion equations (Simunek et al., 1996), showed that that the percolation of imported salts and the dissolution of naturally occurring salts like gypsum can lead to salt transport from land surface into aquifers 20-40m deep within decades (Schoups et al., 2005). Moreover, transport times of contaminants are heavily determined by local-scale geologic heterogeneity. While contaminants mobilized along highly conductive interconnected pathways may account for initial plume arrival, contaminants that migrate in and out of aquitards are responsible for the tailing ends of breakthrough curves (Weissmann et al., 2002). Imported salts and natural rock-water dissolution alone may lead to aquifer salinization on decadal-long time scales (Schoups et al., 2005) coupled with the dispersion of contaminant arrival times (Weissmann et al., 2002), implies that modeling the long-term evolution of these nonpoint source contamination processes, especially in the context of slow-moving closed basin groundwater salinization, is necessary to understand trends in regional inorganic groundwater quality.             Methods to measure and model regional nonpoint source groundwater contamination involve (1) groundwater quality monitoring programs, and (2) development of flow and transport models calibrated to these observations. Each of these approaches and the methodologies that accompany them are discussed in following two sections.Statistical Methods for Characterizing Regional Scale Groundwater Quality      Characterzing groundwater quality data require methods to address the utility of parametric v. non-parametric statistical tests, and the spatial declustering of data to facilitate the calculation of meaningful and spatially unbiased results and predictions. Groundwater quality data is often lognormally distributed with a few observations at very high concentration (Helsel and Hirsch, 2002); this is the case for the Tulare Basin. Skewed data may render parametric statistical tests less meaningful if the mean is not a good measure of the central tendency of the data. Parametric tests on log-transformed data thus become more useful measures of the data, as do non-parametric tests, which are data-centric and do not depend on distributions (Journel, 1983). Helsel and Hirsch (2002) present robust methods for parametric and non-parametric statistical tests for in groundwater quality data, and accompanying measures of uncertainty. To ensure comparability to other contaminants, Toccalino and Norman (2006) and Worrall and Kolpin (2003) demonstrated that by normalizing groundwater contaminant concentrations to benchmarks relevant to human health, comparisons of groundwater vulnerability to other contaminants becomes possible. Clustered data can be declustered in a number of ways. Belitz et al. (2010) present a method for computing the aquifer scale proportion, which is a nondimensional measure of regional-scale groundwater quality that they define as the proportion of an aquifer with constituent concentrations above a specified threshold. This can be based on a human health relevant benchmark, such as a maximum contaminant level (MCL) ensuring comparability to other contaminants of concern (Toccalino and Norman, 2006).             When data is heavily clustered such as in thus research, Journel (1983) recommends equal area declustering to estimate a global mean based on weighted averages of local values to incorporate all available data in the analysis. In this approach, spatially-weighted local values of aquifer scale proportion [1] are calculated at each grid cell i, and the global value [2] is simply the average of weighted local values for all grid cells n.                   p ̂_i= f_i=k_i/〖nw〗_i                                                                           [1]            p ̂=  1/n ∑_(i=1)^n▒p ̂_i                                                                           [2]      where	i 	is a local grid cell [-],	f 	denotes the observation frequency [-],	k 	is the number of water quality samples with high concentrations in cell i [-],	nw 	is the number of well samples in cell i [-],	p ̂ 	is the global weighted proportion of aquifer with high concentration [-], and	n	is the number of cells [-].            k in equation 1 can also represent the median of all observations within a cell, so that the average of the medians [3] yields a spatially declustered regional average. The global mean from cell declustering can vary based on the number of cells in the grid, and thus it is important to find the grid that maximizes and minimizes the global mean, for a sensitivity analysis of model (i.e. - grid cell size) choice (Belitz et al., 2010). Confidence intervals for the global mean are determined by a consideration of sample size (number of wells), sample design, and the dispersion of high concentration samples (Belitz et al., 2010).  Perfectly dispersed high concentration samples imply that data are not clustered; the global mean is the unweighted mean, and the confidence intervals are calculated using the actual number of wells. Since the data are clustered, effective number of cells (n*) and effective number of water quality samples with high concentration (k*), are calculated as functions of cluster parameters and used to find the confidence interval. Brown et al., (2001) provide a framework for selecting the appropriate confidence interval methodology based on sample size, showing that for larger samples, the Wilson, Jeffreys and Agresti-Coull are comparable, and for small samples, the Wilson and Jeffreys are recommended.            Figure 2: An example of equal area declustering of groundwater nitrate observations in the Central Valley, California (Geier et al., 2015).            This research does not expand upon the methodology of the aquifer scale proportion or the geostatistical methods of equal area weighting and declustering, rather, it applies them to a unique contaminant class, and at specific depth and time intervals for a comprehensive first-look at regional TDS patterns in shallow and deep aquifers in the Tulare Basin with all available data.             In the Tulare Basin, Fujii and Swain (1995) noted that shallow ground water salinity is influenced primarily by sediments derived from marine sedimentary rocks originating in the Coast Range, San Emigdio Mountains, and Tehachapi Mountains, and likely from unusual exposures of similar marine formations in the Sierra Nevada. Moreover, Fuji and Swain note that ground water in areas of lower salinity are generally associated with igneous and metamorphic rocks from the Sierra Nevada. Given these trends, separate analyses will be conducted for the eastern and western Tulare Basin. East and west areas will be stratified by available geomorphic data.      Physical Models of Regional Scale Groundwater Quality & Nonpoint Source Contamination            Flow and transport models are useful methods to incorporate system characterization into the realm of hypothesis testing under different water management scenarios. Because closed basin groundwater salinization is a regional-scale hydrologic phenomenon it is most appropriately modeled with a regional groundwater model, two of which exist for California’s Central Valley. Those models are the Department of Water Resources’ California Central Valley Groundwater-Surface Water Simulation Model (C2VSim), built on the IWFM platform (Brush et al., 2013; California Department of Water Resources, 2013), and the United States Geologic Survey’s Central Valley Hydrologic Model (CVHM), built on MODFLOW 2000 (Faunt ed., 2009; Harbaugh et al., 2000). There are methodological differences in how the models treat agricultural demand and flow in the unsaturated zone, but this research concerns flow of deep groundwater, making either model suitable to this question. Both MODFLOW and IWFM solve the generalized groundwater flow equation [3] by discretizing the domain into finite differences and elements, respectively. Groundwater flow in most aquifers occurs under laminar conditions (Fetter, 2001; Haitjema, 1995).                  ∂/∂x (K_x  ∂h/∂x)  +  ∂/∂y (K_y  ∂h/∂y)  +  ∂/∂z (K_z  ∂h/∂z)  = S_s  ∂h/∂t                                       [3]      where	K_x,〖 K〗_y, K_z	are the hydraulic conductivities along the x, y, and z axes (L/T),	h		is the potentiometric head (L),	S_s		is the aquifer specific storage (1/L), 	t		is time (T), and	∂		signifies the partial derivative of the variable that follows.The magnitude and direction of groundwater flow is responsible for advective based transport in groundwater. Transport models such as the Modular Three Dimensional Multispecies Transport Model (MT3D) solve the advection-dispersion equation [4] under generalized hydrogeologic conditions using the advection-dispersion equation (Bedekar et al., 2016).      θ (∂C^k)/∂t+ ρ_b  (∂C ̅^k)/∂t  =∂/(∂x_i ) (θD_ij  (∂C^k)/(∂x_j ))-  ∂/(∂x_i ) θv_i C^k+ q_s C_s^k  -q_s^' C^k- λ_1 θC^k  - λ_2 ρ_b C ̅^k       [4]      where	θ	is the porosity or volume averaged water content (-),	C^k	is the dissolved concentration of species k (M/L3),	t	is time (T),	ρ_b	is the bulk density of the subsurface material (M/L3),	C ̅^k	is the concentration of species k sorbed to subsurface material, mass/mass (M/M),	x_i  , x_i	are the distances along the i and j coordinate axis (L),	D_ij	is the dispersion coefficient tensor, as area/time (L2/T),	v_i	is the linear pore water velocity (L/T),	q_s  	is the volumetric flow rate per unit volume representing sources or sinks (T),	C_s^k 	is the source or sink concentration of species k (M/L3),	q_s^' 	is the change in water storage per unit volume (1/T),	λ_1 	is the first-order reaction rate for the dissolved phase (1/T),	λ_2 	is the first-order reactions rate for the sorbed (solid) phase (1/T), and	∂ 	signifies the partial derivative of the variable that follows.	            Both MODFLOW and MT3D are developed by the United States Geologic Survey, so the finite-difference-generated groundwater velocity flow field from MODFLOW is easily coupled with MT3D’s numerical solvers. Percolation Theory and Downscaling Transport Phenomena      This research seeks to develop regional groundwater quality management models by downscaling 3D heterogeneous domains to 2D heterogeneous models that reproduce the distributions of contaminant arrival times and concentrations produced by the more realistic 3D models. This downscaling process can be achieved more than one way, and methods and insights from the field of percolation theory are particularly useful to this problem, as percolation and connectedness of high-conductivity material exerts a strong influence on solute transport (Fogg, 1986; Fogg et al., 2000; LaBolle and Fogg, 2001; Fogg and Zhang, 2016). The 3D heterogeneous models produce connected networks wherein preferential flow and transport occurs in the connected high-K media, and at the same time, significant mass transfer occurs between the aquifer facies and the typically abundant, lower-K media such as silts and clays (LaBolle and Fogg, 2001). As demonstrated at the MADE experimental site (Bianchi and Zheng, 2016), such heterogeneity leads to early- and late-time tails in the contaminant breakthrough curves. In other words, compared to conventional Fickian models of transport, the solute breaks through much sooner than anticipated, and slow but massive bulk rates of mass transfer between the aquifers and aquitards both sequester mass and serve as long-term sources of mass that can trickle back into the system for decades or centuries (LaBolle and Fogg, 2001).             Studies in percolation theory (Harter, 2005; Hunt, 2005) have confirmed that if high-permeability cells are randomly and independently placed in a 3D cubic lattice, continuous connectivity of permeable cells that span the domain are obtained at a proportion of 0.31—that is, percolation is reached when 31% of cells out of the total number of cells are permeable. In correlated lattices such as aquifers, percolation can occur at much lower thresholds due to the emergence of interconnected highly permeable pathways for flow (Fogg et al., 2000; Carle, 1996; Harter, 2005). If a 2D slice is taken out of a realistic 3D field, it loses its connectivity even though it has the appropriate relative proportion of materials. Therefore, in downscaling from 3D to 2D correlated lattices, the resulting 2D field must adapt its interconnectivity to achieve similar percolation rates, as greater proportions of high conductivity cells are needed to achieve percolation in 2D than in 3D.             One first-order approach to generating connected 2D conductivity fields is to take a slice from a 3D field, and manually shuffle geofacies to achieve connectivity. Another more reproducible method that has been used to generate connected 2D fields involves simulating and then modifying the multivariate Gaussian distribution (Zinn and Harvey, 2003), from here forward referred to as the multigaussian distribution.      Figure 3: Method of downscaling a 3D heterogeneous field to a 2D field.

Fields like this will be explored as a potential method to develop the hydraulic conductivity fields needed for 2-D MODFLOW-MT3D transport simulations.            Integrating Groundwater Sustainability into Multi-Reservoir Network Models      Multi-reservoir network models can vary widely in complexity and the degree to which the physics of the system is represented (Loucks and van Beek, 2017). In landscapes where groundwater pumping satisfies a portion of the water demand, multi-reservoir network models typically offer some representation of groundwater, which may be simplified to fit the model architecture (Draper, 2001; Zikalala, 2012). In California, fundamental differences in the methodologies of water systems analysis and groundwater modeling, coupled with a policy of unlimited groundwater pumping framework has resulted in statewide multi-reservoir models that do not explicitly optimize for model groundwater sustainability, although they can represent processes like MAR, albeit simply. Notably, the conveyance infrastructure along which how those water transfers might take place is in place. This research will use the CALifornia Value INtegrated model (CALVIN) to test hypotheses on statewide joint operation of surface and groundwater reservoirs for statewide managed aquifer recharge.      Developed in the early 2000s, CALVIN is a hydro-economic optimization model combining concepts and methods from economics, single-objective optimization, and water systems analysis to achieve representation of integrated statewide water resources management in the state of California (Draper, 2001). The model optimizes surface and groundwater deliveries to agricultural and urban water users, maximizes total statewide urban and agricultural value, and represents water markets by transferring limited water resources between users according to their willingness to pay. In this way, CALVIN mimics real-world economic processes, while (1) adhering to physical constraints of water flow and (2) utilizing historical hydrologic input data. Water demand in CALVIN is based on projected 2050 water demand.             CALVIN is a perfect foresight optimization of the objective function [5] to minimize statewide water shortage and operation costs, subject to upper bound [6], lower bound [7], and mass balance constraints on flow [8].                  min(z)=∑_i▒∑_j▒∑_k▒〖C_(i,j,k) X_(i,j,k)   〗                                                          [5]            subject to:              X_(i,j,k)≤ u_(i,j,k)                                                                            [6]            and:      x_(i,j,k)≥ l_(i,j,k)                                                                              [7]and:          ∑_j▒∑_i▒〖X_(i,j,k)= ∑_i▒∑_j▒〖a_(i,j,k) X_(i,j,k)+ b_(j                              )   〗  〗                           [8]            where	i, j, k	are nodes,      c	is the cost of weighting factor per unit of flow through the link [$],	X	is flow [L3/T],	u	is the upper bound [L3/T],      l	is the lower bound [L3/T],      a 	s the amplitude used to represent losses [-], and      b	is a local inflow into node j.                  Perfect foresight models have been criticized because real-life processes are more stochastic, and water managers will never have perfect foresight of droughts, floods, peaks in demand, and so forth. However, these models have are relatively tractable and capable of representing large scale, distributed water transfer networks (Haliassos, 1994), In the case of water resources management, perfect foresight optimization models represent theoretical best-possible outcomes. Flow in CALVIN is constrained by upper and lower bounds through links, enabling the parameterization of realistic upper bounds for processes like groundwater recharge between diversion canals and groundwater spreading basins. Recent research using ParFlow, a fully-coupled surface-groundwater flow model (Ashby and Falgout, 1996) within a geostatistical domain generated by transition-probability statistics informed by well-log information (Carle, 1999), suggests that the physical limits of groundwater recharge in a confined alluvial aquifer system are highly sensitive to the subsurface geology, specifically the presence of high-conductivity pathways for flow (Maples & Fogg, 2016). Results from physically-based models like ParFlow help to bound CALVIN and set realistic parameters for accurate recharge representation.             MAR is acknowledged for its potential to improve groundwater quantity (Scanlon et al., 2016), but this research seeks to define how sources of MAR (i.e. – clean v dirty recharge) might also impact groundwater quality. Hydrodynamic models are an appropriate model choice to test how regional groundwater quality might respond to various levels of regional-scale MAR, but quantifying how much water is actually available, and if it is economically feasible to convey that water throughout California to recharge sites is a question for hydroeconomic optimization models.      CONCEPTUAL ELEMENTSChapter 1:Groundwater Salinization Resulting from Open-to-Closed Basin Conversion in an Agricultural BasinMotivation:       Due to the lag between contaminant introduction and actual breakthrough at monitoring wells, measurable effects on deeper groundwater typically requires decades of monitoring data to detect statistically meaningful trends (Fogg and LaBolle, 2006). In the San Joaquin Valley and the greater Tulare Basin, nitrate found in drinking water wells today is the result of fertilizer application at least a decade ago (Harter et al., 2012). Some monitoring data in the San Joaquin Valley show long-term degradation of groundwater quality, for example, a four-decade trend of increasing mean nitrate concentration in groundwater (Dubrovsky, 1998). Much like nitrate, regional nonpoint source contamination from TDS is an emerging concern. Preliminary estimates by the California Environmental Protection Agency indicate that annual state and federal water projects deliveries to the Tulare Lake and San Joaquin River Basins constitute over two million tons of salt to the region, which, due to a lack of drainage, migrates into groundwater (Cismowski et al., 2006). Much like the findings from Harter et al. (2012), it may be decades before we see the full effects of groundwater salinization in the Tulare Basin.            This chapter hypothesizes that TDS accumulation in the Tulare Basin, and in similar irrigated landscapes, is the product of closed-basin salt accumulation, and that that salt must migrate into deep groundwater over time. As an initial step in scoping the size and severity of the problem without building a complex 3D flow and transport model that accounts for advection, dispersion, geochemical reactions, and the role of geologic heterogeneity in transport, a simple, homogenous mixing cell model of solute transport is built to model the 1D vertical transport of salts in the Tulare Basin. Research Questions: 		What are first-order estimates of the timescales, depths, and concentrations associated with groundwater salinization in a regional alluvial aquifer system? How does aquifer salinization propagate in the vertical (z) direction? Looking towards the available data, how is TDS in the Tulare Basin distributed spatially and temporally? What is the de-clustered, spatially unbiased regional change in shallow and deep groundwater TDS over the period of record?Specific Objectives: Develop a simple, deterministic mixing cell model of solute transport that computes the rough timescales, depths and concentrations associated with regional groundwater salinization in the Tulare Basin. Validate the model with TDS v. depth data over the period of record. Calculate changes in the spatially declustered aquifer scale proportion of TDS above the EPA MCL (1,000 mg/L) for both shallow and deep groundwater in the Tulare Basin.  Calculate regional average TDS concentrations for calibrating the flow and transport model in Chapter 3. Methods:       Mixing cell models are not computationally intensive and have successfully been used in place of complex flow models to provide preliminary estimates of water budgets, mass flux, and contaminant concentrations while still representing the dominant physics of the system (Carroll et al., 2008; Kirk and Campana, 1990; Soulis et al., 2001). Parameters for the mixing tank model were derived from the hydrologic model C2VSim and from previous reports and academic literature written about the Tulare Basin. Because of its extensive representation of surface-groundwater interaction, groundwater pumping, and three-dimensional aquifer structure, C2VSim was chosen as a proxy model to provide the water budgets, groundwater velocities, and spatial dimensions used in this mixing tank model. The transient C2VSim model was run for the 40-year period from 10/31/1961-9/30/2001 and averaged to generate an average annual water budget. Boundary conditions for initial concentrations were assigned by the depth-concentration relationship for groundwater quality data prior to and including 1960 (Chapter 1). To account for uncertainty in unknown parameters, Monte Carlo simulation of unknown parameters was employed. Because of the low-computationally intensive nature of the mixing model, Monte Carlo can be run any number of times to obtain a distribution of outputs from which the mean of the output and the 0.025th and 0.975th quantiles were obtained as the mean, 5% and 95% confidence intervals respectively. Because the mixing model is homogenous in domain, and does not consider the early-time arrival of contaminants taking interconnected high-conductivity pathways, or late-time arrival of contaminants held back in less permeable sediments, the confidence intervals in this study are a first step towards representing the effects of heterogeneity on ending concentrations. The Monte Carlo model mixing cell model was run 1,000 times.            TDS data used in the validation step of this chapter was sourced from the United States Geologic Survey, the California Department of Public Health, the Groundwater Ambient Monitoring and Assessment Program, the Environmental Defense Fund, the California Department of Water Resources, and independent dairy farm monitoring wells. To calculate spatially declustered aquifer scale proportions of high TDS wells, this research follows the methodology of Belitz et al. (2010), where aquifer scale aquifer scale proportion in a grid based approach is simply defined by the weighted average of aquifer scale proportions [2-3], as discussed in the Methodological Background. Modifying equations [2-3] to calculate the median TDS concentration at each equal area grid, and the average median concentration across all grid cells yields the a spatially unbiased regional average TDS concentration for a given sub-sample of wells within a depth class and time frame.            Aquifer scale proportions will be calculated for shallow and deep groundwater wells across time frames. Well depth classification is based on well type. Domestic and monitoring wells are classified as “shallow”, whereas municipal supply wells, agricultural production wells, and industrial supply wells are classified as “deep”. This classification system is in accordance with the CV-SALTS initiative (LWA, 2013). Mean depths of these categories are estimated from wells within that classification that contain explicit, quantitative depth measurements. Alternatively, because not all agricultural and municipal supply wells are deep, and not all domestic and monitoring wells are shallow, it may become necessary to rely solely on the 5,003 wells in the USGS dataset. Uncertainty dependent on spatially clustered data will be accounted for with the Wilson and Jeffreys intervals if the sub-sample size is sufficiently small (n≤40), and with the Wilson, Jeffreys and Agresti-Coull intervals if the sub-sample is sufficiently large (n≥40) (Brown et al., 2001).       Each data source is slightly biased in terms of spatial, depth, and temporal coverage. Data clusters around particular timeframes, indicating different funding priorities and research initiatives. An attempt to include all available data into the analysis will be made, but if noisy data makes the problem less tractable, as mentioned before, using the USGS dataset provides the best temporal and spatial coverage, as well as information on well depth.             Because sediment and underlying geology strongly correlates with shallow groundwater quality in the Tulare Basin (Fujii and Swain, 1995), separate analyses will be completed for the east and west side of the Tulare basin; this stratification will be based on available soil data in databases such as Soil Survey Geographic Database (Soil Service Survey Staff Natural Resources Conservation, n.d.). Expected Outcomes/Contributions:	Results from the mixing cell model represent a first step towards conceptualizing salt-accumulation dynamics in this hydrogeologic system. First order calculations provide a foundation on which to base a more detailed and rigorous 3D transport model, which is the subject of Chapter 2. Moreover, this research will produce non-dimensional (aquifer scale proportion) and dimensional (average regional TDS [M/L3]) statistics of regional groundwater TDS. A manuscript of findings will be submitted to Advances in Water Resources or the Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies by end of Spring 2018.Preliminary Results:      Under current water management practices, shallow aquifers (up to 250 ft. below land surface) exceed maximum contaminant levels for total dissolved solids within 50 years, while deep aquifers (approaching 1,000 ft. deep) see the first signs of impacted after 350 years. The mixing cell model indicates that groundwater salinization in a closed basin is driven primarily by the lack of discharge of these salts, the import of new salts via surface waters, and internal rock-water interactions. The driving set of hydrogeologic characteristics leading to groundwater salinization are common to aquifers worldwide, and pose a threat to the groundwater quality sustainability in irrigated basins where the driving factors for open-to-closed system state conversion are present.Figure 5: Boundary conditions used for the initial TDS concentration v. depth profile of the mixing cell model.Figure 6: Evolution of 1D groundwater salinization in the homogenous mixing cell model with rock water interactions represented. Pumped groundwater and imported surface water relatively high in TDS is applied to the top of the model, which accumulates salt more rapidly than deeper layers. The red line indicates the Monte Carlo simulation mean, the grey polygon indicates the extent of the 5 and 95% confidence intervals, and the black dashed line at 1,000 mg/L TDS indicates the maximum contaminant level for drinking water. Figure 7: Evolution of 1D groundwater salinization in the homogenous mixing cell model without rock water interactions. Salt accumulation is less severe than in Figure 4, but still indicates significant degradation of groundwater quality.      Preliminary results from the mixing cell model suggest that salt accumulation in a groundwater basin may result in significantly deteriorate groundwater quality on similar times scales to overdraft. This motivates the development of more sophisticated and complex regional groundwater quality management models which represent geologic heterogeneity, aquifer connectivity, and transport processes such as advection and dispersion. Such models, in order to achieve broad use and impact, must be tractable and computationally inexpensive. Thus, the subject of chapter 2 involves downscaling geologic heterogeneity and connectivity observed in 3D models to simple 2D models of salt transport, and rapid scenario testing on these downscaled models.	A validation step comparing model output to regional TDS analyses in the Tulare Basin is ongoing. The following figures demonstrate that outlying data, likely from a few locations obfuscate local-scale trends, but generally, shallow groundwater TDS has increased over the last century, while deep groundwater TDS has remained relatively constant. These observations provide some validation to the mixing cell model. Smaller scales of spatial binning should result in more clear signals, like those observed in Figure 6, on the west side of the Tulare basin.Figure 8: (A) Spatial distribution of wells over the entire Tulare Basin, binned by time period. (B) Smoothed regressions show that deep groundwater TDS, roughly deeper than 750 ft. has not changed much since 1922. Shallow (< 250 ft.) aquifer TDS has increased.Figure 9: (A) Spatial distribution of wells on the east side of the Tulare Basin, binned by time period. (B) Like Figure 8 and 10, deep groundwater TDS, roughly deeper than 750 ft. has not changed much since 1922. Shallow (< 250 ft.) aquifer TDS has increased.Figure 10: (A) Spatial distribution of wells on the west side of the Tulare Basin, binned by time period. (B) Like Figures 6 and 7, deep groundwater TDS, roughly deeper than 750 ft. has not changed much since 1922. Shallow (< 250 ft.) aquifer TDS has increased. Figure 11: Modeled GW salinization with zero rock water interactions (green) and with rock water interactions (blue) compared to data from the Western Tulare Basin. Model agreement with data is good, which is partially explained by relatively declustered data available on the west.             Groundwater quality data in the Tulare Basin is well-distributed spatially, with more data spatially concentrated near the urban centers of Fresno and Bakersfield. Temporally, groundwater quality data ranges from 1902-2014. Data is sparse and uneven from 1902-1983, and offers more spatial coverage from 1980-2014. The data shows increases in groundwater TDS in shallow aquifers at similar magnitudes, depths and temporal scales as the mixing cell model, offering partial validation of the model, and motivation for a more complex approach to modeling transport. Chapter 2:Downscaling of Transport and Development of Regional-Scale Groundwater Quality Management ModelsMotivation: 		In California, the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (2014) requires groundwater sustainability agencies to monitor and take steps to ensure groundwater quality sustainability on sub-regional scales. Regional-scale problems that are also slow-moving, like nonpoint source contamination from closed basin salinization, may be left unaddressed because the regional scope of the problem extends beyond local regulatory boundaries. Meanwhile, efforts in many basins are underway to offset negative changes in storage by employing MAR. This research seeks to develop computationally inexpensive regional groundwater transport models, and test how the TDS concentration of recharge water affects the evolution of groundwater salinization. Research may show that increasing groundwater storage and improving water quality in closed hydrogeologic basins are not mutually exclusive goals.      Groundwater quality models have the potential to inform decision-making for best outcomes, but these models range in their representation of transport phenomena, and in computational cost. Highly resolved geostatistical models have been shown to reproduce the effects of transport, namely the dispersion in travel times (Weissmann et al., 2002) due to preferential flow paths and geologic heterogeneity. K-fields in groundwater flow models used for water management often offer simplified, layered representations of aquifer heterogeneity, likely because of the high computational cost of geostatistical models and an added degree of complexity. The goal of this chapter is to develop downscaled flow and transport models that produce similar breakthrough curves observed in 3D heterogeneous models in 2D representations of these systems. A 2D model that reproduces results from a 3D model will broadly impact the field of water quality management, allowing hypothesis within a relatively fast-running model that reproduces the 3D effects of early and late time arrival of contaminants.             With the developed, downscaled 2D model, simulations of various levels of regional-scale managed aquifer recharge with different contaminant loads will allow a deeper understanding of the relationships between water management and the evolution of groundwater salinization in a closed basin. Moreover, models as ones to be developed might gain broad use by water management agencies owing to their accuracy in representing transport, and ability to be run on local desktops within reasonable time frames. Research Questions: 	What geostatistical methods lead to the development of 2D heterogeneous fields that best reproduce transport dynamics in a 3D system? Will filling up a basin until groundwater discharges to surface water slow or reverse salinization? What is the effect of applying different contaminant loads (i.e. – clean sources like MAR v. dirty sources such as pumped groundwater) on the evolution of groundwater salinization?Specific Objectives: Use the developed 3D Kings River Fan model (Weissmann et al., 2004) generated within transition probability geostatistical software (T-PROGS) model to obtain a set of breakthrough curves.  Extract a 2D slice from the 3D model, which does not have the adequate interconnection compared to the 3D version, and measure breakthrough using the unaltered 2D model. Adjust the 2D slice to produce more connectivity to observe the response of the system to transport.  Experiment with the alteration approaches of Zinn and Harvey (2003), using multigaussian simulation to generate connected 2D fields.  With a working 2D model that reproduces the breakthrough curves observed in 3D models, simulate recharge of various concentrations (i.e. – clean v. salty) to observe the effects of recharge type on the evolution of GW salinization. Methods:      For solving the advection dispersion equation, a variety of tools are available. Because it pairs easily with MODFLOW, MT3D will be tested first for suitability to the problem. Alternative transport codes to consider include RWHet (Yong et al., n.d.), and RW3D (Henri and Fernandez-Garcia, 2012). Flexibility in the choice of transport code to use is critical when continuous loads are applied to the domain over long simulations, which might challenge the code’s ability to handle an increasing number of particles from the continuous loading of the system.            The 3D field will come from a pre-developed 3D T-PROGS model of the Kings River Fan alluvial aquifer (Weissmann et. al., 2004), and an accompanying calibrated MODFLOW model. Breakthrough curves at observation wells under simple (i.e. - steady state) boundary conditions will be obtained. A 2D slice from this 3D model will then be extracted to begin testing transport on. Gradually, interconnection will be manually created in this 2D K-field to test the effects on transport. With a working 2D model that reproduces the breakthrough curves observed in 3D models, observing the effects of recharge concentration on the evolution of GW salinization will be tested. As an alternative to manually creating connection, methods from the Geostatistical Software Library (Deutch and Journel, 1997) can be used to create multigaussian simulations of 2D fields that mimic 3D connectivity (Zinn and Harvey, 2003). Expected Outcomes/Contributions:	Results will inform unanswered and fundamental questions in closed basin hydrogeology: what are the timescales of basin salinization, can clean recharge improve groundwater quality, and if so on what timescales? Results will potentially lend more weight to the argument of storing more water in underground reservoirs, which in addition to improving regional groundwater quality, one day might improve the health of groundwater dependent ecosystems (Howard and Merrifield, 2010), reduce rates of land subsidence (Galloway and Burbey, 2011) and contribute towards the optimization of total water storage capacity (Döll et al., 2012). Modeling tools and methodologies developed in this chapter will provide tools rapid transport simulation by groundwater quality managers and the transport modeling community.Chapter 3:Impacts of Surface Reservoir Re-operation and Managed Aquifer Recharge on Shortages and Total Water Storage in an Agricultural Basin Motivation:       As a result of climate change, California is expected to experience more extreme precipitation events and a reduction of winter snowpack (Pachauri and Meyer, 2014; Tebaldi et al., 2006; Vicuña et al., 2011). In addition to providing hydropower and flood control, surface-water reservoirs are designed to capture the spring and summer season runoff, precisely when irrigation demand peaks in the Central Valley. Reduced snowpack in the state challenges the efficacy of California’s surface-water reservoirs. On the other hand, extreme precipitation events in the winter, irrespective of year type (i.e. – wet, dry, normal), will be released for flood control, and ultimately flow into the ocean, as California’s surface reservoir system totaling 47 km3 (38.1 MAF) of capacity is insufficient to capture and store these flows. California’s groundwater system, has the storage capacity to accommodate these flows which in years with high magnitude flow could provide in excess of average annual groundwater overdraft in California (Kocis and Dahlke, 2017), but research into how these water transfers might take place, how much groundwater can actually be banked, and how that will change total water storage is lacking.             Shifting towards sustainable water management by storing more water underground can mitigate social and ecological crises related to water shortages, increase resilience to droughts, and enable long-term storage and the emergence of water markets (Gleick, 1998; Scanlon et al., 2016). Storing more water underground can also slow land subsidence, improve the health of groundwater dependent ecosystems, and potentially improve regional groundwater quality.Research Questions: 	How will extended winter (November – April) reservoir re-operation for MAR change total water storage in an agricultural basin in California? Can excess winter rainfall be transferred and stored in groundwater without additional costs to water users? Specific Objectives: Cut out a smaller model of the Folsom reservoir and groundwater system from the CALVIN model to enable rapid simulation. Create links in the CALVIN cutout model between the appropriate diversion canals and the CVPM 08 groundwater basin to be recharged. Reset upper and lower bounds on outflow links to the Delta during winter months to reroute water for MAR. Evaluate the effects of various “groundwater sustainability windows” on total water storage and costs to users. Use upscaled maximum recharge rates from hydrogeologic models to constrain MAR to physically reasonable volumes.Methods:	Python v3.0, specifically pyomo, a Python-based, open-source library will be used to solve the CALVIN optimization equation [6]. There are a few ways to simulate MAR within the CALVIN linked network structure, but the most straightforward way is to create links from diversion nodes downstream of a surface water reservoir directly into groundwater. Upper bounds based on physically feasible monthly recharge volumes can be set along the MAR link into groundwater. This alone is not sufficient to simulate MAR in California—wintertime boundary conditions for discharge into the Delta must be augmented to allow lower-than-historical flows, but not lower than environmental flow targets, thus “freeing” excess water in the system for recharge. This step in the modeling process requires an examination of historical Delta outflow, and a modification of these conditions during the winter months to reflect environmental flow targets. Figure 12: A cutout example of the CALVIN flow network model showing Folsom Reservoir, Folsom South Canal, and CVPM region 8. Reservoirs are represented as triangles. Preliminary work has focused on operating a MAR link between C173 and GW-08. For the larger California-wide model, similar links will be identified and built.Expected Outcomes/Contributions:	Utilizing a network flow economic optimization model, Chapter 3 will explore the feasible physical limits of regional-scale MAR that might lead to sustainable groundwater management, and compare this management scenario to historical operations. Four scenarios will be tested by varying end of period groundwater storage conditions (i.e. – imposing groundwater sustainability), and practicing statewide MAR (i.e. – creating new links for MAR and setting winter Delta outflow constraints).          Figure 8: Chapter 3 simulation scenarios.	Scenario (1) in CALVIN is a no-shortage simulation, namely because groundwater pumping always makes up any deficit in available water. In scenario (2), shortages are expected because groundwater sustainability constraints are imposed, without creating another source of water because historical flows to the Delta are fixed. Scenario (3) allows any excess flows that would otherwise exit the Delta to be baked via MAR, if they maximize benefit to users in the system. The difference in shortage between scenario (3) and (2) indicates how much benefit winter MAR through joint operation of surface and groundwater reservoirs can offer. Scenario (4) tests the hypothesis that building additional infrastructure for MAR will create less shortage and increase total water storage. Scenario (5) investigates the effect of a regularly imposed groundwater sustainability constraint at intervals of ten and twenty years. Lastly, scenario (6) seeks to constrain overly-optimistic recharge volumes by leveraging insights from a hydrodynamic model (Maples, 2016) to inform the upper bound along MAR links. Preliminary Results:Figure 13: (A) There is extra water in the system that can be recharged. Most of it occurs in winter pulses. (B) Increasing diversion canal capacity (1) facilitates the rapid delivery of flows for winter recharge, and (2) non-winter deliveries, which indirectly increases groundwater recharge via return flow. (B), (C) and (D) Adhering to groundwater sustainability  constraints without additional sources of water negatively affect surface water storage and result in shortages. MAR alone is not enough. MAR combined with re-operation results in stable reservoir levels and low shortage, volume but worse groundwater storage. MAR, re-operation, and expanding diversion canal capacity maximizes total water storage.      A working cutout model of the Folsom Reservoir and CVPM groundwater region 8, with a working and MAR link has been used to test scenarios (1) – (4), with scenarios (5) and (6) pending. Preliminary results suggest that imposing groundwater sustainability constraints results in shortage volume (green scenario), and a reduction in surface water storage throughout the simulation. Reservoir re-operation (blue scenario) for MAR shows that amount of excess water to be recharged, which eliminates shortage volumes, but also results in more negative groundwater storage change, as this water (along with redirected Delta outflow) is used to curb shortages and maximize economic benefit to users. Lastly, reservoir re-operation combined with doubling the capacity of the diversion infrastructure—Folsom South Canal—shown as the purple scenario, results in the least negative groundwater storage change, comparable shortage volume and surface water storage to scenarios (1) and (3).CONCLUSION      In arid, agriculturally-intensive regions of the world like California, open-to-closed hydrologic basin conversion is an uninvestigated and critically important topic with large implications for sustainable groundwater quality. In fact, if declines in inorganic groundwater quality observed in the Central Valley aquifer, as well as aquifers nationwide (USGS, 2016) are the first signs of TDS contamination from irrigation, then present-day societies are only beginning to see the contaminant legacy of irrigated agriculture. Declines in groundwater quality in regions like the Tulare Basin are accompanied by unsustainable declines in groundwater storage. This research seeks to bridge the gap between groundwater quality and quantity by investigating the effects of MAR on the evolution of groundwater salinization, and the optimization of total water storage in ground and surface water reservoirs. Results from this research will advance the field of regional scale groundwater quality management, and develop methodologies for jointly-operating surface and groundwater reservoirs to maximize total water storage.       TIMELINE	I present a 3-year timeline to completion.
